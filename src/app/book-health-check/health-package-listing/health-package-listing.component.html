    <p class="font-10">Dermatology is that branch of medical science which is associated with the diagnosis and
      treatment of skin related issues, such as diseases affecting the skin, hair and the nails. Specialists who excel
      at dermatology are called dermatologists. Skin is one of the sense organs of the human body that protecting it
      from injuries, infections and bacteria. Skin disorders are common and everyone among us experience skin related
      problems in life, including old people, children and infants. Diagnosis and treatment of disorders, cancers,
      diseases and ageing conditions of the skin are not the only activities in dermatology. There are other important
      functions as well. Topical and systemic medications, dermatologic surgery and dermatologic cosmetic surgery,
      phototherapy, laser therapy, radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy are some of the major treatment methods
      applied by a dermatologist. Being a good dermatologist involves sufficient training in microbiology,
      biochemistry, physics, endocrinology, physiology, pathology and other disciplines. Dermatology is often
      associated with internal problems and hence, the dermatologist must be familiar with other disciplines.
      Dermatologists treat skin disorders like warts, skin cancer, dermatitis, fungal infections, psoriasis, acne, hand
      dermatitis and eczema. A qualified dermatologist concentrates on multiple activities like acting as consultants
      to other specialists, seeing patients in private or in hospitals, teaching and carrying out research work on
      their medical field. Common treatment methods include medications and injections. Surgeries are used in critical
      cases which include extraction of skin cancers, growths and performing biopsies. Apollo makes life easier for you

    <p class="font-10">6 Face Washing Mistakes that are Damaging Your Skin, Everyday! Face-washing may be a simple
      everyday task that requires no great effort on your part. But when it?s not done right, it causes significant
      harm to your skin, each day. The mistakes that you may make while washing your face could lead to issues like
      irritation, dryness and even wrinkles. Read on to find out how you can avoid making these common errors, and save
      your skin from blemishes, ageing and lustreless look. 1. Using the wrong cleanser The use of the wrong cleanser
      can throw your ph levels out of balance. The optimal ph balance of your skin is 5.5ph. This is the ideal level at
      which the thin protective layer on the surface of the skin (called acid mantle) can function to keep germs,
      toxins and bacteria at bay. You should therefore be picking your cleanser based on your skin type as it would
      come with the right ph balance. 2. Not cleaning your hands before touching the face Always clean the germs and
      dirt of your hands first before moving onto your face. Ignoring this crucial first step can cause you to transfer
      all the bacteria and dirt of your hands on your face, giving rise to common skin problems such as acne, pimples
      and blackheads. 3. Using a pre-used washcloth To avoid the filth from clogging your pores, always clean the
      washcloth that you use with an antiseptic to keep germs and bacteria at bay. Once you're done washing your face,
      don't rub the cloth all over your face but pat dry it. 4. Washing face using with hot water When it comes to the
      water that you splash on your face, you should always use lukewarm or room temperature water. This is because hot
      water leaves your skin dry as it washes away the skin's essential oils; and cold water can break the capillaries
      (fine blood vessels) of your skin. In contrast, mildly lukewarm water will keep your skin hydrated and healthy.
      5. Not washing the face twice a day Just as you shouldn't ignore this important skin care habit that keeps your
      skin clean, you also shouldn't go overboard with it. Excessive face-washing can hamper the natural oil production
      of your skin, giving rise to dryness and irritation as a result. Your skin requires the natural oil it produces
      to keep it smooth and supple. Ideally, you should wash your face twice daily - once in the morning for removing
      the bacteria and dirt that clogged your pores, and again at night before going to bed. 6. Rushing through the
      routine Lastly, don't rush through your cleansing routine. Make sure to properly rinse your face of cleanser
      completely, otherwise the residues would cause your skin to dry up later on, leading to skin irritation. It is
      therefore very important to pay attention to all the little details that make up your face-washing routine. By
      doing it right, you get to achieve the clear and blemish-free skin that you always wanted.</p>
